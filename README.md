# Pokemon

With pygame library

## Description :

Pokemon type game with graphical user interface, name, health points, levels, attack power, defense, at least 18 types (who decide characteristics : HP, ATK, DEF), can evolve, with combat system between two pokemons, can miss attack, if life is zero then message with name of winning pokemon, they will be saved in a pokedex.json file. The pokedex will be the team : if a pokemon loses, it disappears from it.

### Going further :

At launch : new game or saved game, if new game then pokedex = 0, user can use multiple pokemons, can choose between attack or switch pokemon. Can also have flee option.
Exploration mode (Like Safari Park)but only if everything else is perfect.

We can use existing pokemons or create some, but the art part will be heavy
